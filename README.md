Pitch
<br>Yelp, but for campgrounds.
<br>As my final project in Colt Steele's Full Stack Developer bootcamp, we're tasked with designing a yelp clone, 
but for campsites. Built in express, it includes user authentication, comments, uploading of new campgrounds on site using mongodb and a simple bootstrap design. Can be readily refactored into a multitude of different uses.
